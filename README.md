Fraud Detection System Project Documentation
Introduction
I developed a fraud detection system aimed at identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using a publicly available Credit Card Fraud Dataset. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and creating a simple testing interface to demonstrate the system’s functionality.

1. Data Preprocessing
In the initial phase of the project, I focused on preparing the dataset for effective model training. The dataset was highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing a very small fraction of the total data. To address this, I applied  undersample , which helped in balancing the dataset.
Additionally, I performed feature engineering to enhance model performance. This included normalizing transaction amounts.

Model Training
For the detection of fraudulent transactions, I trained a Random Forest classifier,Gradient boosting classifier, which is well-suited for handling complex, non-linear relationships in the data. I carefully tuned hyperparameters such as the number of trees to optimize performance.
I also experimented with Gradient Boosting models to compare results and ensure the best possible detection accuracy. The Gradient boosting model demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Model Evaluation
To assess the effectiveness of the fraud detection system, I evaluated the model using key classification metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score. Given the critical nature of fraud detection.
The evaluation results indicated that the model achieved a strong balance between identifying fraudulent activities and limiting false positives, with an F1-score reflecting overall reliable performance.

Testing Interface
To facilitate practical testing and demonstration, I developed a simple command-line interface that allows users to input transaction features and receive an immediate prediction on whether the transaction is fraudulent.
This interface outputs both the predicted class and the probability of fraud, enabling users to understand the model’s confidence in its prediction. This component makes the system user-friendly and ready for integration into larger applications or real-time transaction monitoring systems.

Conclusion
Throughout this project, I successfully built a fraud detection system that effectively identifies fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. The project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, model training and evaluation, and creating user interfaces for machine learning models.
